REFACTORED: This file now imports from the new modular service components
while maintaining complete backward compatibility.

The original 1531-line monolithic implementation has been split into:
- McpConnectionManager: Connection management
- McpToolExecutor: Tool execution  
- McpStatusChecker: Status monitoring
- McpConfigManager: Configuration management
- McpLogger: Logging operations
- McpErrorHandler: Error processing
- McpOrchestrator: Unified facade

For new code, consider using the individual services directly:
from ..services.mcp import McpOrchestrator, McpConnectionManager, etc.

This file maintains the original interface for backward compatibility.
